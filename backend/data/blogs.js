    description:"This blog is a playful look at gardening from all angles by Andrew O’Brien. Recent blog posts have covered gardening clothes (as he posed the question of ‘do you ever garden wearing jeans?’ to his twitter audience) and a blog entitled ‘You snooze, you lose’- which was a fantastic post pointing out that February is NOT a time to rest in your garden.They take awesome photos. Seriously, you need to check out their blog if only for the pictures. But they’re also master designers as well as gardeners, as their backyard oasis looks like a slice of heaven (actually, it might be…).They’re based in the same gardening zone as me, the coveted zone 10b of San Diego, CA and started out as completely fresh gardeners about 8 years ago in 2007, when they moved to the area. Since then their blog has been honored by the New York Times as one of the best gardening blogs online, and I completely agree.It’s awesome and very inspiring. Give it a look – I have it saved in my feeds so I never miss a post.",
