    description:"This blog is a playful look at gardening from all angles by Andrew O’Brien. Recent blog posts have covered gardening clothes (as he posed the question of ‘do you ever garden wearing jeans?’ to his twitter audience) and a blog entitled ‘You snooze, you lose’- which was a fantastic post pointing out that February is NOT a time to rest in your garden.",

    description:"If you’re not seduced by the photography used on this blog site, then you certainly will be by the words. This site is actually a collective, so features blogs from more than one writer. Recent posts have celebrated Hamamelis in the winter garden, as well as suggested ways to inject a contemporary feel into your gardening containers.",
